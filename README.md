Doge _can_ look up!

**doge** is a command-line DNS client, like `dig` forked from the amazing work done [here](https://github.com/ogham/dog).
It has colourful output, understands normal command-line argument syntax, supports the DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocols, and can emit JSON. I belive this is an amazing project and should be improved on.

## Examples

    doge example.net                          Query a domain using default settings
    doge example.net MX                       ...looking up MX records instead
    doge example.net MX @1.1.1.1              ...using a specific nameserver instead
    doge example.net MX @1.1.1.1 -T           ...using TCP rather than UDP
    doge exapple.net MX @1.1.1.1 -p 53        ...using a nonstandart port
    doge -q example.net -t MX -n 1.1.1.1 -T   As above, but using explicit arguments

## Installation

Currently:
    1. Pull the repo and cd into it
    2. Ensure you have rust installed and openssl-dev ( On Debian: libssl-dev, On Arch: openssl, and RHEL: openssl-devel)
    3. build with cargo and enjoy.
<!-- To install dog, you can download a pre-compiled binary, or you can compile it from source. You _may_ be able to install dog using your OS’s package manager, depending on your platform. -->

### Project existence 
    I am not a rust expert at all, Honestly I'm the opposite, just learning codding. I use [dog]() on my arch system and a few random *nix
    Laptops that I perpetually fix and break . As such part of this progect will be outside of my skill set or ability to work on currently. Things such as :
        *Windows support as a whole
        *MACOS support as a whole (I'm never buying a mac so this won't be touched by me) I'll merge PRs if thats you thing
        *Docker is magic as far as im concerned. I'm working on learning how to practically use it, but for now I wouldn't hold my breath
    
    If any of these are things you want to see make a PR and I'll read and merge it, Be on the lookout for some potentially dumb questions from me.

### Packages

    Work in progress
<!-- - For Arch Linux, install the [`dog`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/dog/) package.
- For Homebrew on macOS, install the [`dog`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/dog) formula.
- For NixOS, install the [`dogdns`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=dogdns&query=dogdns) package. -->


### Downloads

Binary downloads of dog are available from [the releases section on GitHub](https://github.com/Dj-Codeman/doge/releases/) for ~~64-bit Windows~~, ~~macOS~~, and Linux targets. They contain the compiled executable, the manual page, and shell completions.


### Compilation

doge is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
I working on rustc version [1.76.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/02/08/Rust-1.76.0.html) you should be running this version or newer.
The recommended way to install Rust for development is from the [official download page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), using rustup.

To build, download the source code and run:

    $ cargo build
    $ cargo test

- The [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner can be used to run some helpful development commands, in a manner similar to `make`.
Run `just --list` to get an overview of what’s available.

- If you are compiling a copy for yourself, be sure to run `cargo build --release` or `just build-release` to benefit from release-mode optimisations.
Copy the resulting binary, which will be in the `target/release` directory, into a folder in your `$PATH`.
`/usr/local/bin` is usually a good choice.

- To compile and install the manual pages, you will need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
The `just man` command will compile the Markdown into manual pages, which it will place in the `target/man` directory.
To use them, copy them into a directory that `man` will read.
`/usr/local/share/man` is usually a good choice.


### ~~Container image~~
#### These may still work but they will be unstable as I might break them.

To build the container image of doge, you can use Docker or Kaniko. Here an example using Docker:

    $ docker build -t doge .

You can then run it using the following command:

    $ docker run -it --rm doge

To run dog directly, you can then define the following alias:

    $ alias doge="docker run -it --rm doge"


### End-to-end testing

doge has an integration test suite written as [Specsheet](https://specsheet.software/) check documents.
If you have a copy installed, you can run:

    $ just xtests

Specsheet will test the compiled binary by making DNS requests over the network, checking that doge returns the correct results and does not crash.
Note that this will expose your IP address.
For more information, read [the xtests README](xtests/README.md).


### Feature toggles

doge has three Cargo features that can be switched off to remove functionality.
While doing so makes doge less useful, it results in a smaller binary that takes less time to build.

There are three feature toggles available, all of which are active by default:

- `with_idna`, which enables [IDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name) processing
- `with_tls`, which enables DNS-over-TLS
- `with_https`, which enables DNS-over-HTTPS (requires `with_tls`)

Use `cargo` to build a binary that uses feature toggles. For example, to disable TLS and HTTPS support but keep IDNA support enabled, you can run:

    $ cargo build --no-default-features --features=with_idna

The list of features that have been disabled can be checked at runtime as part of the `--version` string.
