##  Overview

The dns-doge project is an open-source DNS client tool built with Rust and designed for seamless integration into your software ecosystem. The core functionalities of this project can be navigated through the repository structure, anchored by the Cargo.toml file that sets up essential dependencies for dns utilities, command-line functionality, transaction ID generation, json output, and logging. This configuration ensures a comprehensive DNS client in your software arsenal.The project's codebase includes a Dockerfile which compiles the Rust project using release mode in the first stage, utilizing Debian as the operating system for the second stage. The required packages are then installed, and the compiled binary is copied into the image for execution. This enables simple deployment of your dns-doge tool.The EU Placed Under Contribution Agreement (EUPL) license governs the usage of this project. By adhering to its terms, contributors gain the freedom to modify the codebase while maintaining its core functionality, broadening the reach and utility of this DNS client tool. Furthermore, attribution is required when redistributing the code snippets from this project, ensuring credit due for original contributions. Lastly, diligence is expected in accepting external files under this license, as proper distribution terms must be confirmed to maintain a harmonious ecosystem within the dns-doge community.
